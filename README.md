# Pipedream Snippet Generator

## Overview

The Pipedream Snippet Generator is a React-based application designed to help users create and manage Pipedream snippets easily. By providing an intuitive interface, users can define event triggers, headers, and return values, ultimately generating JavaScript snippets that can be used in Pipedream's custom code blocks.

## Features

- **Dynamic Step Management**: Add and remove steps dynamically, allowing for flexible snippet creation.
- **Customizable Event Data**: Define body and header data for triggers, which will be included in the generated snippet.
- **Snippet Generation**: Automatically generate a complete JavaScript snippet ready to be copied and used in Pipedream.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and responsive design built with React for an enjoyable user experience.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pipedream-snippet-generator.git
   cd pipedream-snippet-generator
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

1. **Add Steps**: Click the "Add Step" button to create a new step in your snippet.
2. **Define Event Body and Headers**: For each step, you can add key-value pairs for the event body and headers.
3. **Generate Snippet**: After defining your steps, click the "Generate Snippet" button to create the final JavaScript snippet.
4. **Copy Snippet**: Use the "Copy Snippet" button to easily copy the generated code to your clipboard for use in Pipedream.

## Example Output

The generated snippet will look like this:

```javascript
// Import your required npm packages
import axios from 'axios';

async function run(steps) {
  const eventData = steps.trigger.event;

  try {
    return eventData;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    return { error: error.message };
  }
}

(async () => {
  const steps = {
    trigger: {
      event: {
        body: { key: 'value' },
        headers: { key: 'value' }
      }
    },
    step_0: {
      $return_value: { key: 'value' }
    }
  };
  const result = await run(steps);
  console.log('Result:', result);
})();
```
